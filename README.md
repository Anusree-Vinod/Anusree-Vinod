I don’t describe myself with titles. I work on problems until they stop being vague. Sometimes that looks like code. Sometimes it looks like data.

What I actually do

• Build projects to understand systems, not just frameworks.

• Work with data until it tells a clear story.

• Train models, test assumptions, break things, fix them.
